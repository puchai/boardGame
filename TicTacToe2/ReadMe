1) Files submitted 
Common.h Ticgame.h GamePieces.h 
lab2game.cpp GameFunc.cpp lab2game.cpp
README.txt: readme file

2) Usage:
lab2game.exe <TicTacToe>


3) Errors in Compile and execution:
error 1) Signed/unsigned unmatch
solution: change int to unsigned int
error2)  Enum and struct redefinitions
solution: forgot to define header files.

==========================================
			Program Test
======================================
 When the progrme starts, it will prints out a blank board that waits for the user to insert.

 0 1 2 3 4
 ( the above is the graph of the game board)
the program then will give the user a message that specify the requirements of the input string
Please enter a comma seperated pair of unsigned decimal integers '0,0' or 'quit'
if we type 1,1 the program will shows a updated board with the infomation of the user and postion of the piece.

 0 1 2 3 4
 Player O: 1,1

 if we type 1=2, or other badly formed string the program will do nothing but give a information message
 Not a valid command. Please type in again (in comma-separated pair of unsigned decimal integers).

 if we type a position that was already occupied, then we will have the following message
 place was already occupied, pick a difference place

 if we type in a postion where is out of the game board then we will have the below texts
				
	Invaid, Input are out of bound

if one player wins the game the program will stop and gives a message indicates who wins.
if the players fill all the spaces and the game is still not finished then the draw method will be called and will return a
a string and error code. 
 


========================================
           Error Code Test
========================================
1): successful trial
H:\My Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\lab1game\Debug>lab2game.exe TicTacToe
echo %errorlevel%
0 (succeed)
Summary: excuation with no warnings and errors and gives correct outputs and correct error code
		 Running as expected


2): Wrong number arguments and wrong argument name
H:\My Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\lab1game\Debug>lab2game.exe
Usage: Lab2game.exe TicTacToe
(only one argument)
echo %errorlevel&
2 (wrong_number_arguments)
Summary: If pass in unexpected number of arguments (not equals to 2). the programe will return a usage message.
		 And returns correct error code as expected.

4): board is full ( draw()function called )
   if the players fill all the spaces and the game is still not finished then the draw method will be called and will return a 
   specific error. 
 6 (no_valid_space)
   
5): quit game
   if we type quit command the program will stop and gives us a message that indicates the game is quit.
   Note: I use cerr command to print out the error code in the program. (which is 3 in this case--game_quit)
